# nightlight
This is a simple "smart" night light built for my kids. The idea is to turn on lights when motion is detected and to light the way to other rooms in the middle of the night. 

* Turns on a RGB light when the ambient light in the room is below a certain threshold 
* Turns on an LED when the ambient light is below a certain threshold and motion is detected
* Communicates with another device via RF module to turn on lights in other rooms when motion is detected and ambient light is low.
